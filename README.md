# ScoreKeeperApp 

This code is for an interactive application that I worked on for the football season. 

The GUI for this application contains 9 buttons and a live scoring view that updates with each time any of the buttons are engaged. 

The colors and the layout can be changed to suit the needs or scoring mechanism of another sport.
